       "\"Homebush Bay, New South Wales —Earlier today, the Australian Gliders beat the Chinese women's national wheelchair basketball team 57–45 at the Rollers & Gliders World Challenge taking place at the Sport Centre at the Sydney Olympic Park.China won the game's opening tip off but did not score in their first time down the floor. Australia's Sarah Stewart took and missed Australia's first shot. China's 1.5 point player Li Yanhua eventually made the game's first basket. Cobi Crispin made Australia's first basket at 6:55 left in the first quarter, successfully turning her basket into a three point play by making her free throw as a result of a personal foul. Aggressive first quarter play resulted in four Chinese personal fouls with 5:21 left. The first quarter ended 13–9 in China's favour.The first half ended 24–20, with China leading. China's lead came with a high level of energy, the bench loudly supporting their players, few substitutions, lots of on the court talk, playing a half court game that involved setting up the defense early and fouling. In contrast, Australia played a different first half. The team did not yell from the bench or on the court, had many substitutions, ran the shot clock down and played a full court defense.The second half contrasted visibly with the first. Fewer fouls were made by both teams. Australia continued to run the shot clock down but their bench woke up, started cheering loudly for their teammates and made fewer substitutions. The Australians tied the game 34–34 with 1:54 left in the third quarter. China's answer to the closer game was to start substituting players. Tactically, things were little changed as neither team changed their defensive game. The game was tied again at 9:01 left in the fourth with a score of 38–38. Australia was up 42–38 at 7:14 left in the fourth. Some of China's defensive difficulties continued to hold them back, including a player who entered the box early for a second time during a free throw shot by an Australian player.The Gliders will play tomorrow at 2:30pm Sydney time in the first place match against an opponent to be determined in a game later today between Germany and Japan.\""

Context: Look at the surrounding text to understand the topic. 2. Categories: Consider the type of the entity (person, organization, location, etc.). 3. Modifiers: Pay attention to words or phrases that add details to the mention. 4. Co-references: Check other mentions of the same entity in the text. 5. Temporal and Geographical Factors: Consider when and where the text was written. 6. External Knowledge: Use knowledge from outside the text. Remember, effective entity disambiguation requires understanding the text thoroughly, having world knowledge, and exercising good judgment. Your job is to decide whether a candidate should stay on the shortlist for an entity in context. Output **\"yes\"** if the candidate is a **plausible match** for the entity mention based on the context. Output **\"no\"** if the candidate is **clearly irrelevant or incompatible** with the context, even if the entity names look similar. Do **not** default to \"yes\" if you\\'re unsure — use clues from the context, entity type, and modifiers to guide your decision. Example 1: entity: Australian. context: \"Earlier today, the ###Australian### Gliders beat the Chinese women\\'s national wheelchair basketball team 57–45 at the Rollers & Gliders World Challenge.\" candidate: Australia — A country in the Southern Hemisphere that includes the mainland of the Australian continent, Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. {\"final_decision\":\"yes\",\"reasoning\":\"The mention \\'Australian\\' modifies \\'Gliders\\', a known Australian team.

In the context of a sports match, \\'Gliders\\' refers to a sports team, not a flying machine.\"} Now, I will provide you with an entity, its context, and a candidate with its description. The entity in the context is highlighted with \\'###\\'. entity: Australian context: Homebush Bay, New South Wales —Earlier today, the ###Australian### Gliders beat the Chinese women\\'s national wheelchair basketball team 57–45 at the Rollers & Gliders World Challenge taking place at the Sport Centre at the Sydney Olympic Park.

Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. It is the largest country in Oceania and the world\\'s sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries . Please analyze the information and determine if the entity and the candidate are related.

The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. The population of million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. The country's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to European discovery with the arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century, who named it New Holland. In 1770, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788, a date which became Australia's national day. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the time of an 1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established. On 1January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories. Being the oldest, flattest and driest inhabited continent, with the least fertile soils, Australia has a landmass of . A megadiverse country, its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east and mountain ranges in the south-east. Its population density, 2.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, remains among the lowest in the world. Australia generates its income from various sources including mining-related exports, telecommunications, banking, and manufacturing. Australia is a highly developed country, with the world's 14th-largest economy. It has a high-income economy, with the world's tenth-highest per capita income. It is a regional power and has the world's 13th-highest military expenditure. Australia has the world's eighth-largest immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 29% of the population. Having the third-highest human development index and the eighth-highest ranked democracy globally, the country ranks highly in quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties and political rights, with all its major cities faring well in global comparative livability surveys.

Home to people of many different ethnic origins, religious and national origins, the Australian culture and law does not correspond nationality with race or ethnicity, but with citizenship and loyalty to the country. Australia is a multicultural society and has the world's ninth-largest immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 29% of the population. Many early settlements were penal colonies, which were home to transported convicts (who often later became ex-convicts) along with free settlers and administrators. Immigration increased exponentially from the 1850s, following a series of gold rushes. Further waves of immigration occurred after the First and Second World Wars, with many post-World War II migrants coming from Europe, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and to a lesser degree, from Latin America and Africa. Prior to British settlement, Australia was inhabited by various indigenous peoples – Aboriginal Australians, Aboriginal Tasmanians and Torres Strait Islanders, a Melanesian people. A small percentage of present-day Australians descend from these peoples. The development of a separate Australian identity and national character is often linked with the anti-transportation and nativist movements and the Eureka Rebellion during the colonial period and in the lead-up to Federation, as well as the period surrounding the First World War. However, Australian culture predates the federation of the Australian colonies by several decades – Australian literature, most notably the work of the bush poets, dates from colonial times. Modern Australian identity draws on a multicultural and Anglo-Celtic cultural heritage.\"},\n",

As a modern nation of large-scale immigration, Australia has a unique blend of culinary contributions and adaptations from various cultures around the world, including Indigenous Australians, Asians, Europeans and Pacific Islanders. Indigenous Australians have occupied Australia for some 65,000 years, during which they developed a unique hunter-gatherer diet, known as bush tucker, drawn from regional Australian flora and fauna. Australia became a collection of British colonies from 1788 to 1900, during which time culinary tastes were strongly influenced by British and Irish migrants, with agricultural products such as beef cattle, sheep and wheat becoming staples in the local diet. The Australian gold rushes introduced more varied immigrants and cuisines, mainly Chinese, whilst Australia's post-war multicultural immigration program led to a large-scale diversification of local food, particularly under the influence of Mediterranean and East and South Asian Australians. Australian cuisine in the 21st century reflects the influence of globalisation, with many fast-food restaurants and international trends becoming influential. Organic and biodynamic foods have also become widely available alongside a revival of interest in bushfood. Australia has become famous for the high quality of its exports, with major agricultural industries including cattle and calves, wheat, fruit and nuts, vegetables, milk, sheep and lambs (for meat and wool), poultry, barley, canola. The country is also well regarded for its locally-made wine, beer and soft drinks.

Even before Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, the nation pledged its support alongside other states of the British Empire and almost immediately began preparations to send forces overseas to engage in the conflict. The first campaign that Australians were involved in was in German New Guinea after a hastily raised force known as the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force was dispatched from Australia to seize German possessions in the Pacific in September 1914. At the same time another expeditionary force, initially consisting of 20,000 men and known as the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), was raised for service overseas. The AIF departed Australia in November 1914 and, after several delays due to the presence of German naval vessels in the Indian Ocean, arrived in Egypt, where they were initially used to defend the Suez Canal. In early 1915, however, it was decided to carry out an amphibious landing on the Gallipoli peninsula with the goal of opening up a second front and securing the passage of the Dardanelles. The Australians and New Zealanders, grouped together as the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), went ashore on 25 April 1915 and for the next eight months the Anzacs, alongside their British, French and other allies, fought a costly and ultimately unsuccessful campaign against the Turks. The force was evacuated from the peninsula in December 1915 and returned to Egypt, where the AIF was expanded. In early 1916 it was decided that the infantry divisions would be sent to France, where they took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front. Most of the light horse units remained in the Middle East until the end of the war, carrying out further operations against the Turks in Egypt and Palestine. Small numbers of Australians served in other theatres of war. While the main focus of the Australian military's effort was the ground war, air and naval forces were also committed. Squadrons of the Australian Flying Corps served in the Middle East and on the Western Front, while elements of the Royal Australian Navy carried out operations in the Atlantic, North Sea, Adriatic and Black Sea, as well as the Pacific and Indian Oceans. By the end of the war, Australians were far more circumspect. The nation's involvement cost more than 60,000 Australian lives and many more were left unable to work as a result of their injuries. The impact of the war was felt in many other areas as well. Financially it was very costly, while the effect on the social and political landscape was considerable and threatened to cause serious divides in the nation's social fabric. Conscription was possibly the most contentious issue and ultimately, despite having conscription for , Australia was one of only three combatants not to use conscripts in the fighting. Nevertheless, for many Australians the nation's involvement in World War I and the Gallipoli campaign was seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of the Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war, and Anzac Day is commemorated as a national holiday.\"},\n",

In the late 18th century, there were more than 250 distinct Aboriginal social groupings and a similar number of languages or varieties. At the start of the 21st century, fewer than 150 Aboriginal languages remain in daily use, and all except only 13, which are still being transmitted to children, are highly endangered. The surviving languages are located in the most isolated areas. Of the five least endangered Western Australian Aboriginal languages, four belong to the Ngaanyatjarra grouping of the Central and Great Victoria Desert. Yolŋu languages from north-east Arnhem Land are also currently learned by children. Bilingual education is being used successfully in some communities. Seven of the most widely spoken Australian languages, such as Warlpiri, Murrinh-patha and Tiwi, retain between 1,000 and 3,000 speakers. Some Aboriginal communities and linguists show support for learning programmes either for language revival proper or for only \"post-vernacular maintenance\" (teaching Indigenous Australians some words and concepts related to the lost language).'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Aboriginal Australians are the various indigenous peoples of the Australian mainland, Tasmania, and often the Tiwi Islands. This group contains many distinct peoples that have developed across Australia for over 50,000 years. These peoples have a broadly shared, though complex, genetic history, but it is only in the last two hundred years that they have been defined and started to self identify as a single group. The definition of the term \"Aboriginal\" has changed over time and place, with the importance of family lineage, self identification and community acceptance all being of varying importance. In the past, Aboriginal Australians lived over large sections of the continental shelf and were isolated on many of the smaller offshore islands when the land was inundated at the start of the inter-glacial. However, they are considered distinct from the Torres Strait Islander people, despite extensive cultural exchange. As of 2016 Aboriginal Australians comprise 3.1% of Australia\\'s population. They also live throughout the world as part of the Australian diaspora. Before extensive European settlement, there were over 250 Aboriginal languages. However, today most Aboriginal people speak English, with Aboriginal phrases and words being added to create Australian Aboriginal English (which also has a tangible influence of Indigenous languages in the phonology and grammatical structure). They have a number of health and economic deprivations in comparison with the wider Australian community.'},\n",

This includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, and the island of New Guinea, which comprises Papua New Guinea and Indonesia\\'s Western New Guinea. Situated in the geographical region of Oceania, it is the smallest of the seven traditional continents in the English conception. The continent includes a continental shelf overlain by shallow seas which divide it into several landmasses—the Arafura Sea and Torres Strait between mainland Australia and New Guinea, and Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania. When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice age, including the Last Glacial Maximum about 18,000 BC, they were connected by dry land. During the past 10,000 years, rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands and separated the continent into today\\'s low-lying arid to semi-arid mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea and Tasmania. The Australian continent, being part of the Indo-Australian plate (more specifically, the Australian plate), is the lowest, flattest, and oldest landmass on Earth and it has had a relatively stable geological history. New Zealand is not part of the continent of Australia, but of the separate, submerged continent of Zealandia. New Zealand and Australia are both part of the Oceanian sub-region known as Australasia, with New Guinea being in Melanesia. The term Oceania, originally a \"great division\" of the world, was replaced by the concept of Australia in the 1950s. Today, the term Oceania is often used to denote the region encompassing the Australian continent, Zealandia and various islands in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the seven-continent model. Papua New Guinea, a country within the continent, is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse countries in the world. It is also one of the most rural, as only 18 percent of its people live in urban centres. West Papua, a province of Indonesia, is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups. Australia, the largest landmass in the continent, is highly urbanised, and has the world\\'s 14th-largest economy with the second-highest human development index globally. Australia also has the world\\'s 9th largest immigrant population. The first settlers of Australia, New Guinea, and the large islands just to the east arrived between 50,000 and 30,000 years ago.'},\n",

By the time the last Australian personnel were withdrawn in 1972, the Vietnam War had become Australia's longest war, and was only recently surpassed by Australia's long term commitment of combat forces to the War in Afghanistan. It remains Australia's largest force contribution to a foreign conflict since the Second World War and was also the most controversial in Australian society since the conscription controversy during the First World War. Although initially enjoying broad support due to concerns about the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, a vocal anti-war movement developed in response to Australia's programme of conscription. The withdrawal of Australia's forces from South Vietnam began in November 1970, under the Gorton Government, when 8 RAR completed its tour of duty and was not replaced. A phased withdrawal followed, and by 11 January 1973 Australian involvement in hostilities in Vietnam had ceased. Nevertheless, Australian troops from the Australian Embassy Platoon remained deployed in the country until 1 July 1973, and Australian forces were deployed briefly in April 1975, during the Fall of Saigon, to evacuate personnel from the Australian embassy. Approximately 60,000 Australians served in the war; 521 were killed and more than 3,000 were wounded.\"},\n",

In 1981, the more comprehensive Macquarie Dictionary of Australian English was published. Oxford University Press published their own Australian Oxford Dictionary in 1999, as a joint effort with the Australian National University. Oxford University Press also published The Australian National Dictionary. Broad and colourful Australian English has been popularised over the years by \\'larrikin\\' characters created by Australian performers such as Chips Rafferty, John Meillon, Paul Hogan, Barry Humphries, Greig Pickhaver and John Doyle, Michael Caton, Steve Irwin, Jane Turner and Gina Riley. It has been claimed that, in recent times, the popularity of the Barry McKenzie character, played on screen by Barry Crocker, and in particular of the soap opera Neighbours, led to a \"huge shift in the attitude towards Australian English in the UK\", with such phrases as \"chunder\", \"liquid laugh\" and \"technicolour yawn\" all becoming well known as a result.'},\n",

After the war, the AFC evolved into the Royal Australian Air Force; the remainder of the 1st AIF was disbanded between 1919 and 1921. After the war the achievements of the AIF and its soldiers, known colloquially as \"Diggers\", became central to the national mythology of the \"Anzac legend\".

       "  'text': '\\'Australia\\'s Got Talent\\' is an Australian reality television talent show. The show is based on the Got Talent series format that originated in the United Kingdom with Simon Cowell. The first six seasons aired on the Seven Network, from 2007 to 2012. In the first season the judges were Tom Burlinson, Red Symons and Dannii Minogue. The first season aired at 6:30pm on Sunday nights. After a successful run, the series was given a vote of confidence as Seven moved the show to a more competitive Tuesday night timeslot. The second season aired from 29 April 2008. Burlinson and Symons did not return for season four and were replaced by Brian McFadden and Kyle Sandilands. For season seven in 2013 the show moved to the Nine Network. Dawn French, Timomatic and Geri Halliwell joined the panel as replacements for McFadden and Minogue. On 4 April 2014, it was announced that Nine had axed Australia\\'s Got Talent due to low ratings. On 8 July 2015, Nine announced that the show would be returning in 2016 for an eighth season. The Nine Network aired season eight in 2016, with four new judges: Kelly Osbourne, Ian \"Dicko\" Dickson, Sophie Monk and Eddie Perfect. In December 2018, Seven announced the series would be returning to their network in 2019 for a ninth season. The ninth season, with Ricki-Lee Coulter as host, returned on 28 July 2019. == Overview == Australia\\'s Got Talent is a talent show that features performers of all ages competing for a top prize of between A$100,000 and A$250,000. The season consists of three stages: auditions, semi-finals, and a final. Only highlights are screened from the auditions. Some seasons included auditions in different cities. The judges cull down the approved audition acts to about 40 acts for the semi-finals. In most seasons, the semi-finals included a public vote, with a combination of public and judges\\' choices making the final. Also in the first series, during the semi-finals stage, each judge buzzed either a cross, or a tick. In Season 9, there is no public voting in the semi-finals. The logo used for the first, seventh and ninth seasons of Australia\\'s Got Talent is similar to the logo used by America\\'s Got Talent. The logo during the second to sixth seasons and season eight is similar to that used by Britain\\'s Got Talent.'},\n",

       "  'text': \":This article concerns the men's team; for information on the Australian women's team, see Australia women's international rules football team. The Australia international rules football team is Australia's senior representative team in International rules football, a hybrid sport derived from Australian rules football and Gaelic football. The current team is solely made up of players from the Australian Football League. Although Australian rules football is played around the world at an amateur level, Australia is considered far too strong to compete against at senior level. Hence, selection in the Australian international rules team is the only opportunity that Australian rules footballers have to represent their country. Until 2004 the majority of the men's Australian squad was composed of members of the All-Australian team, as well as other outstanding performers from the season. In 2005 the decision was made to select players best suited to the conditions of the hybrid game, which resulted in a younger, smaller and quicker team being selected. However this was reverted to the All-Australian model ahead of the 2014 series. For the 2013 Series only, the decision was made to select an all-Indigenous team, known as the Indigenous All Stars. Competing in the International Rules Series, the only team Australia plays against is the Ireland international rules football team. The series has been played intermittently since 1984. Australian under-age teams have been represented in the past, as well as a women's team in 2006. Australia last hosted the International Rules Series in 2017.\"},\n",

Context: Look at the surrounding text to understand the topic. 2. Categories: Consider the type of the entity (person, organization, location, etc.). 3. Modifiers: Pay attention to words or phrases that add details to the mention. 4. Co-references: Check other mentions of the same entity in the text.  5. Temporal and Geographical Factors: Consider when and where the text was written. 6. External Knowledge: Use knowledge from outside the text.  Remember, effective entity disambiguation requires understanding the text thoroughly, having world knowledge, and exercising good judgment. Now, I will first provide you with an example to illustrate the task: Mention: {ex['mention']} Context: {ex['surrounding_context']} Candidates: {ex_candidates} Answer: {ex['answer']}. Now, I will give you a new mention, its context, and a list of candidate entities. The mention is highlighted with '###'. Mention: {entity_row['entity_title']} Context: {entity_row['surrounding_context']} Candidates: \"\"\" + \"; \".join([f\"{idx + 1}.{cand['title']} – {cand['text'][:300]}\"  for idx, cand in enumerate(entity_row['candidates_after_pointwise'])]) + \"\"\" Think step by step. At the end output exactly one line with the ID and name of the chosen entity, e.g., '3.Barack Obama'. If none of the candidates are correct, output '-1.None'. Only output a single JSON object in the following format, without line breaks, indentation, or extra text: {\"final_decision\": \"<id>.<entity name>\", \"reasoning\": \"your explanation here\"} \"\"\")\n",
